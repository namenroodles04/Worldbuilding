ZERO--The protagonist. After the ZENITH outbreak, Zero lost all contact with their only remaining family member (their father). 
Since then, they have taken shelter with a local faction that is working towards storming the former HQ of Entech in search of a solution to the virus.

SILAS--The protagonist's father. Former Senior Advisor of Entech Corporation. Declared missing the same day as the outbreak of the ZENITH virus. Presumed dead.

KOR--The protagonist's closest friend. They met eachother at the same faction, but Kor is the only one that knows about Zero's father. She keeps the secret well-kept,
but urges Zero to use any of info they might have about their father to better plan their raid on HQ.

MONTY--Unspoken "leader" of the faction. Stereotypical big, gruff type. One of the only truly selfless people left on Earth, maybe to a fault. Puts the needs
of the faction first, whatever those might be.

ES8-TAN--The being behind the sudden ZENITH outbreak. Certainly not human. Whatever it is, they want nothing to do with humanity, and are aiming for a clean slate.
Humanity was tempted by technology they could never understand and knowledge they could not even dream to posses. ES8-TAN is their reckoning.
