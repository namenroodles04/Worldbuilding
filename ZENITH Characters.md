## ZERO ##
The protagonist. After the ZENITH outbreak, Zero lost all contact with their only remaining family member (their father). Since then, they have taken shelter with a local faction that is working towards storming the former HQ of Entech in search of a solution to the virus.

## SILAS ##
The protagonist's father. Former Senior Advisor of Entech Corporation. Declared missing the same day as the outbreak of the ZENITH virus. Presumed dead.

## KOR ##
The protagonist's closest friend. They met each other in the same faction, but Kor is the only one who knows about Zero's father. She keeps the secret well-kept but urges Zero to use any of info they might have about their father to better plan their raid on HQ.

## MONTY ##
Unspoken "leader" of the N.A.I.L faction. Stereotypical big, gruff type. One of the only truly selfless people left on Earth, maybe to a fault. Puts the needs of the faction first, whatever those might be.

## ES8-TAN ##
The being behind the sudden ZENITH outbreak. Certainly not human. Whatever it is, they want nothing to do with humanity and are aiming for a clean slate. Humanity was tempted by technology they could never understand and knowledge they could not dream to possess. ES8-TAN is their reckoning.
