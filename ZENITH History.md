## Entech Corporation ##
Entech Corporation began as a start-up technology company with a promise to change the world. Seemingly out of nowhere, they began to develop ground-breaking technology such as telepathy, teleportation, advanced AI and android assistants, and even improved prosthetic limbs designed to improve on the "flawed human design." Entech's products exploded in popularity across the globe, until they became the leading producer of most technology-based items. The world lived in a technological golden age for many years, until Entech's historical crash.
## The collapse of Entech ##
A virus, later dubbed the ZENITH virus, spawned out of this sudden boom in technological advancement. It initially went unnoticed, since the major global population was preoccupied with exciting new technology mass-produced by Entech Incorporated. Somehow, a virus spread through this technology and began to wipe out humanity--AI and androids stopped responding to humans, prosthetic limbs became locked in place, and most communication came to a screeching halt. Then, the virus mutated. Androids turned against their human creators, all while not uttering a single word. Most major countries have now fallen into chaos, and the rest of the world is sure to follow suit. Unless, of course, there is a way to stop the spread of the virus. But Entech is no longer to be found.
